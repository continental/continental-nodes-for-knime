Continental Nodes for KNIME Extension
=====================================

Many Continental employees are frequent users of the KNIME Analytics Platform for use cases ranging from data workflow automation to advanced analytics. To improve their data processing and reporting capabilities, we have developed the Continental Nodes for KNIME Extension.


Functionality
-------------

The Continental Nodes for KNIME Extension consist of different nodes that serve various purposes. Some are of algorithmic nature, most deal with exposing XLS formatting capabilities to KNIME users for reporting purposes. Technically, we expose functionality of the Apache POI library to the KNIME user. Comprising many formatting options, we follow typical KNIME usage patterns that especially allow dynamic input table specifications.


Typical Usage
-------------

The source code provided here is typically not compiled by the user. We also do not distribute binaries by ourself. The most common and recommended way of using the Continental Nodes for KNIME Extension is via the KNIME software itself and its extension mechanism. We intend to collaborate with KNIME AG in making our extension available as community extension via their update site.
