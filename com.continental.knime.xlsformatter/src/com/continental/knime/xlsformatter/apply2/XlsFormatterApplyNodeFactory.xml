			<p>
			The XLS Formatter (apply) node applies the chained commands from XLS Formatter nodes to an unformatted xlsx file.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			All previous XLS Formatter nodes do not modify any xlsx files yet but prepare the formatting steps to be taken here. 
			The input file may not contain any formatting yet (except very few styles that are tolerated due to date/time values handling).
			</p>
			
			<p><i>This node supports the 
            </i><a href="https://docs.knime.com/latest/analytics_platform_file_handling_guide/index.html#path"><i>path flow variable</i></a>
            <i> to specify the source and destination location. To convert the created path column to a string column which is 
            required by some nodes that have not been migrated yet you can use the </i>
            <a href="https://kni.me/n/ZLCisQlHCzW4IiZG"><i>Path to String</i></a><i> node.

        <tab name="Settings">
	        	<option name="Read from">
				Select a file system which stores the .xlsx file you want to read. There
				are four default file system options to choose from:
				<br />
				<ul>
		                <li><i>Local File System:</i> Allows you to select a file from your
		                    local system.
		                </li>
		                <li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Allows you to read from a mountpoint.
		                	When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose the mountpoint.
		                	Unconnected mountpoints are greyed out but can still be selected (note that browsing is disabled in this case).
		                	Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.
		                	A mountpoint is displayed in red if it was previously selected but is no longer available.
		                	You won't be able to save the dialog as long as you don't select a valid i.e. known mountpoint.
		                </li>
		                <li><i>Relative to:</i> Allows you to choose whether to resolve the path
							relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
		                When selected, a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the two options to use.
		                </li>
		                <li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Allows to specify a URL (e.g. file://, http:// or knime:// protocol). 
		                    When selected, a spinner appears that allows you to specify the desired connection and read timeout in milliseconds.
		                    In case it takes longer to connect to the host / read the file, the node fails to execute.
		                    Browsing is disabled for this option.
		                </li>
					</ul>
				It is possible to use other file systems with this node. Therefore,
				you have to enable the file system connection input port of this node
				by clicking the
				<b>...</b>
				in the bottom left corner of the node's icon and choose
				<i>Add Source File System Connection port</i>
				.
				<br />
				Afterwards, you can simply connect the desired connector node to this node.
				The file system connection will then be shown in the drop-down menu.
				It is greyed out if the file system is not connected in which case you have to (re)execute the connector node first.
				Note: The default file systems listed above can't be selected if a file system is provided via the input port.
			</option>
			<option name="File/URL">
				Enter a URL when reading from <i>Custom/KNIME URL</i>, otherwise enter a path to a file. The
					required syntax of a path depends on the chosen file system, such as &quot;C:\path\to\file&quot; (Local
					File System on Windows) or  &quot;/path/to/file&quot; (Local
		            File System on Linux/MacOS and Mountpoint). For file systems connected via input port, the node
		            description of the respective connector node describes the required path format.
					You can also choose a previously selected file from the drop-down list, or select a location
					from the &quot;Browse...&quot; dialog.
					Note that browsing is disabled in some cases:
					<ul>
						<li><i>Custom/KNIME URL:</i> Browsing is always disabled.</li>
						<li><i>Mountpoint:</i> Browsing is disabled if the selected mountpoint isn't connected.
						Go to the KNIME Explorer and connect to the mountpoint to enable browsing.</li>
						<li><i>File systems provided via input port:</i>
						Browsing is disabled if the connector node hasn't been executed since the workflow has been opened.
						(Re)execute the connector node to enable browsing.</li>
					</ul>

			<option name="Write to">
				Select a file system in which you want to write the formatted .xlsx file. There
				are four default file system options to choose from:

	                    local system.

						relative to the current mountpoint, current workflow or the current workflow's data area.
	                When selected a new drop-down menu appears to choose which of the three options to use.
